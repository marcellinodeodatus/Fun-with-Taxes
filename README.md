# Fun-with-Taxes
3/3/2020.
This program is to demonstrate understanding of if statements and concepts of simple tax returns.
This program will read in three pieces of information: the user's gross income, number of dependants, and the amount of tax that was already withheld.
The program then will output a message in console whether:
1) The user should receive a refund of certain amount of dollars, or
2) The user still owe money in taxes, or
3) The user have paid all the taxes and owe no money.
